# Introduction

## What is CJ?

In *comparative judgment* (CJ) studies [@Thurstone_1927a; @Thurstone_1927b]:

::: incremental
- judges assess a specific trait or attribute
- across different stimuli
- by performing pairwise comparisons
- producing a dichotomous outcome
:::

. . . 

e.g., when assessing writing quality, judges compare pairs of written texts (the stimuli) to determine the relative writing quality each text exhibit (the trait) 

---

## Is it succesful?

Numerous studies document the method's effectiveness in assessing traits and competencies. They have focus on three aspects:

::: incremental
- Reliability
- Validity
- Practical applicability
:::

---

## Introduction (cont.)

Result on **reliability:**

::: incremental
- CJ needs a modest number of pairwise comparisons [@Verhavert_et_al_2019; @Crompvoets_et_al_2022] 
- CJ can generate precise and consistent trait scores compared to other assessment methods [@Coertjens_et_al_2017; @Goossens_et_al_2018; @Bouwer_et_al_2023].
- CJ has equal, if not superior, time efficiency than other assessment methods [@Pollitt_2012b; @Verhavert_et_al_2022; @Mikhailiuk_et_al_2021].

## Introduction (cont.)

Result on *validity:**

::: incremental
- CJ scores represent accurately the traits under measurement [@Whitehouse_2012; @vanDaal_et_al_2016; @Lesterhuis_2018_thesis; @Bartholomew_et_al_2018; @Bouwer_et_al_2023].

## Introduction (cont.)

Result on *practical applicability:**

::: incremental
- CJ is versatile across both educational and non-educational contexts [@Kimbell_2012; @Jones_et_al_2015; @Bartholomew_et_al_2018; @Jones_et_al_2019; @Marshall_et_al_2020; @Bartholomew_et_al_2020; @Boonen_et_al_2020].
