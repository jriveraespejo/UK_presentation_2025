Introduction\n\nIn comparative judgments (CJ) studies [1, 2]\n\n\n\n\njudges assess a specific trait or attribute\nacross different stimuli\nby performing pairwise comparisons\nproducing a dichotomous outcome\n\n\n\n\ne.g., when assessing writing quality, judges compare pairs of written texts (the stimuli) to determine the relative writing quality each text exhibit (the trait)"

Introduction\n\nLiterature have documented the effectiveness of CJ on three aspects:\n\n\nReliability\nValidity\nPractical applicability\n\n\n\n\nBut the methodology have some issues …\n\n\nResult on reliability:\n\nCJ needs a modest number of pairwise comparisons [3, 4]\nCJ can generate precise and consistent trait scores compared to other assessment methods [5–7].\nCJ has equal, if not superior, time efficiency than other assessment methods when employing adaptive comparison algorithms [8–10].\n\nResult on validity:\n\nCJ scores represent accurately the traits under measurement [7, 11–14].\n\nResult on practical applicability:\n\nCJ is versatile across both educational and non-educational contexts [14–20]."

    "text": "4. Extending Thurstone’s theory\n\nWe use the structural approach to causal inference [33–36] to formally and graphically representing the assumed (causal) structure of the CJ system. Specifically we use:\n\n\nStructural Causal Models (SCMs) and\nDirected Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)\n\n\n\n\n\nEssentially, SCMs and DAGs function as conceptual models on which identification analysis rests [37].\nIdentification analysis helps researchers to determine whether an estimator can accurately compute an estimand based solely on its (causal) assumptions, regardless of random variability [37].\nIdentification is crucial because it is a necessary condition for ensuring consistent estimators.\nConsistency refers to the property of an estimator whose estimates converge to the “true” value of the estimand as the data size approaches infinity [38].\nWithout identification, consistency cannot be achieved, even with “infinite” and error-free data. Thus, deriving meaningful insights from finite data becomes impossible [37]."
